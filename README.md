## Envisioning Forest Fire Destruction

This project aims to predict the area covered by the fire in case of a forest fire and gauge the destruction that can be caused by this natural calamity. As we know, a forest fire can cause massive destruction and once any forest has witnessed it, there are high chances that the fire can reoccur in that area. So, to prevent future fires and gauging the area, safety measures can be taken to mitigate the damage caused and preventive steps can be taken to avoid such fires in the future.

### Dataset Used: 

forest_fires.csv


- Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing has been carried out on the data in the initial stage.
- For data modeling and predictions, various machine learning algorithms have been used and their performance has been compared by calculating the error metrics.
- Visual representations of the predicted area have been displayed.
